This repo contains crime data and for the cities of Houston and Seattle, and
some scripts that I am hacking together as part of a research project on 
anomoly detection in crime data.

The Seattle data set seems to include much nicer information than the Houston
data set, thus most of the work will be done using Seattle data.
